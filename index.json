[{"content":"Hugo is a static site generator based on Go. It is known for its blazing speed and flexibility, allowing it to render sites within a second or less. It has an advanced templating system that makes it incredibly powerful for building modern websites. Hugo comes with its own server having hot reload functionality, so you can see the site changes instantly in your browser.\nInstalling Hugo First, if you already have an older version of Hugo installed, you need to remove it to avoid version conflicts:\nsudo apt remove hugo Next, install the latest version of Hugo from the official releases. Head over to https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases and download the extended version for your system.\nOnce downloaded, you may install Hugo using the command:\nsudo dpkg -i hugo_extended_*_linux-amd64.deb You may verify the installation using:\nhugo version Creating a New Hugo Site Next, you have to create a new Hugo site. For that, you have to use the command:\nhugo new site mysite Replace mysite with whatever name you want for your site. This will create a new directory with all the necessary Hugo structure.\nAdding a Theme Once the site is created, you need to add a theme. For that, navigate to your site directory:\ncd mysite Then you have to initialize Git using:\ngit init After that, add your theme as a Git submodule. For example, to add the PaperMod theme:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod You can edit the basic site info like title and subtitle using the hugo.toml file. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve added the theme, you may need to specify the installed theme in the hugo.toml file. For example:\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;https://technameer.github.io\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;My Hugo Site\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;PaperMod\u0026#34; Creating Your First Post Then you have to add a posts page by creating the posts folder in the content directory. You can add a new post using:\nhugo new posts/first-post.md This will add a new post file and you will have your first post created. Now you have to add the markdown content of the post.\nImportant: You always have to make the draft parameter false to make it appear on the blog.\nRunning the Development Server You can run the server using:\nhugo server This will start the development server and you can view your site by opening localhost:1313 in your browser. Any changes you make will automatically reload in the browser.\nDeploying to GitHub Pages Now that your site is ready, let\u0026rsquo;s deploy it to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions and the gh-pages workflow.\nStep 1: Create a GitHub Repository First, create a new repository on GitHub with the name username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username. This is important because GitHub automatically serves sites from repositories with this naming pattern.\nStep 2: Push Your Hugo Site to GitHub Initialize your repository if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, and push your code:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git git push -u origin main Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow You have to create a GitHub Actions workflow file to automate the deployment. Create a new directory .github/workflows in your project root:\nmkdir -p .github/workflows There you have to configure the workflow the add the public folders content in the gh-pages branch.\nStep 4: Configure GitHub Pages Once you\u0026rsquo;ve pushed the workflow file, you need to configure GitHub Pages settings:\nGo to your repository on GitHub Click on Settings \u0026gt; Pages Under Source, select GitHub Actions Step 5: Deploy Now commit and push the workflow file:\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy.yml git commit -m \u0026#34;Add GitHub Actions workflow for deployment\u0026#34; git push GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site. You can check the progress in the Actions tab of your repository. Once the workflow completes successfully, your site will be live at https://username.github.io.\nConclusion That\u0026rsquo;s it! You now have a fully functional Hugo site deployed to GitHub Pages. Every time you push changes to the main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site. You can continue adding new posts, customizing your theme, and enjoying the blazing-fast performance that Hugo provides.\nThank You!\n","permalink":"https://technameer.github.io/posts/hugo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHugo is a static site generator based on Go.

You solve the problem but you want to further improve it. You power off your system and again work on the project another day. You find that the problem can\u0026rsquo;t be solved any other way and the only solution to that problem is the one you implemented previously. But there is no way to revert it back. This is where Git comes in.\n📚 Introduction Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is used to manage different versions of code for small to large-scale projects. It has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.\nWhat is Version Control? Version control is a way to track and manage changes made to a project\u0026rsquo;s files over time. Using version control, we can move between different versions of the code.\nLocal vs Distributed Version Control Local Version Control: The code versions are stored in a single machine Distributed Version Control: The code is saved at every developer\u0026rsquo;s machine What is a Repository? Think of a repository as the folder where you store your entire road project. Every map, every design, every version, every experiment, everything you create sits inside this one place.\nIf Git is the tool you use to save checkpoints, and branches are the different side paths you build to test ideas, then the repository is the container that holds all of it. It\u0026rsquo;s the complete box that keeps your main road, your side paths, your history, your notes, and every change you\u0026rsquo;ve ever made.\nWhether you keep this box on your computer or upload it to GitHub\u0026rsquo;s storage garage, the repository is the home of your whole project.\n💾 How Does Git Store Versions of Code? Git just stores the changes made each time, so it is efficient to store the different versions. A commit in Git is a version of the code. In simple terms, it is a snapshot of the code with a message of what change has been made to the code in this version.\nGit uses unique strings called hashes to identify every single commit or snapshot.\n🔧 Installing Git Here I will be explaining how to install Git on Linux. If you are using Ubuntu, you just need to run the following command to install Git:\nsudo apt install git After that, you need to configure your username and email on Git so that it can identify the person that made the commit:\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;you@example.com\u0026#34; 🚀 Using Git for a Project Now that you have installed Git on your system, you will use it in a project. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you are working on a project where you need version control.\nOpen terminal and navigate to the project directory Initialize Git using the command: git init After initializing, you can create commits in the projects and make versions of your code.\n🌿 Branches What are Branches in Git? Think of your project as a long road you\u0026rsquo;ve been building. One day you come up with a new idea that might make the road better. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to tear down the main road because you\u0026rsquo;re not fully sure if this new idea will work. So instead of changing the main road, you build a separate side path.\nOn this side path, you test new designs, try different curves, change the surface, and experiment freely. If the path turns out great, you connect it back to the main road. But if it turns into a mess or leads nowhere, you simply remove it and the main road stays perfectly safe.\nThat side path is a branch.\n🐙 GitHub Continuing the road example, think of GitHub as a giant storage garage where you keep all your road designs safe. Your computer holds your project, but anything can happen to a local machine. If it crashes or gets lost, your work disappears.\nSo you upload your entire road project to this secure garage. Now your team members can also access it, look at the design, suggest improvements, or even build their own side paths and send them back to you.\nGit is the tool you use to build and manage the roads GitHub is the place where you store those roads, share them, and work with others 🔗 Using GitHub You can host your local Git repository on GitHub so that you can collaborate and allow other developers to work on your project.\nConnecting Local Repository and GitHub Repo Login to GitHub and create a new repository Copy the URL of the repository and then run the command: git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository-name.git Check the remote origin URL in local repository by command: git remote -v You should see something like:\no o r r i i g g i i n n g g i i t t @ @ g g i i t t h h u u b b . . c c o o m m : : u u s s e e r r n n a a m m e e / / r r e e p p o o s s i i t t o o r r y y - - n n a a m m e e . . g g i i t t ( ( f p e u t s c h h ) ) Then push using the command: git push -u origin main 📝 Most Commonly Used Git and GitHub Commands Working with Git and GitHub requires remembering a few essential commands.

If you are the kind of person who likes to get most things done from the keyboard without touching the mouse, you will find Linux to be the perfect system for you. In this article, I will guide you through Linux so that you will be comfortable starting to use it.\n🐧 What is Linux? Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning it is software that manages the hardware of a computer. It is freely available for anyone to use and modify. Linux is built around the Linux kernel, which is responsible for managing memory and system resources. Linux comes in different versions called distributions (distros), such as Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. Each distribution has its own interface and features, but the underlying architecture is the same.\nIn this article I will be focusing on Ubuntu and how to install it.\n💻 Installing Linux (Ubuntu) There are different ways you can use Linux:\nWSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): If you are running Windows, you can install WSL and start using Ubuntu without installing it separately. Dual Boot: Install Ubuntu alongside your current operating system. Full Install: Completely remove the current operating system and base your system entirely on Linux. Here is a short overview of how you can install Linux through dual-boot:\nStep 1: Backing Up First you need to backup all your data because dual booting requires shrinking your disk, which risks data loss.\nStep 2: Download Ubuntu ISO Go to the Ubuntu official website Click Download for the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version Save the .iso file to a known location Step 3: Create a Bootable USB Using Rufus Requirements: USB drive with at least 8 GB free\nSteps:\nDownload and run Rufus Insert your USB drive Under Device, select your USB drive Click SELECT and choose the Ubuntu .iso file you downloaded Under Partition scheme, select: GPT for UEFI systems (most modern PCs) MBR for older BIOS systems (To check your system type: Press Win + R, type msinfo32, and look at BIOS Mode) File System: Leave as FAT32 Click START A prompt will appear asking to write in ISO Image mode or DD mode. Choose ISO Image mode Click OK to begin. Wait until Rufus finishes ✅ Your bootable USB is ready!\nStep 4: Shrink Your Windows Partition You need free space for Ubuntu.\nPress Win + X and select Disk Management Find your main Windows drive (usually C:) Right-click it and select Shrink Volume Enter the amount of space to shrink (at least 25–50 GB recommended for Ubuntu) Click Shrink You\u0026rsquo;ll see Unallocated space on your drive. Leave it as is; Ubuntu will use it during installation Step 5: Boot from the USB Insert the bootable USB and restart your PC Press the Boot Menu key (commonly F12, F10, Esc, or Del) when the manufacturer logo appears Select your USB drive from the list The Ubuntu boot menu will appear. Choose Install Ubuntu Step 6: Choose Installation Type Select Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager if this option appears If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, select Something else (manual partitioning) Manual steps for \u0026ldquo;Something else\u0026rdquo;:\nClick the unallocated space Click + to create a new partition: Size: 25–50 GB (or more) Type: Primary Location: Beginning of this space Use as: Ext4 journaling file system Mount point: / Step 7: Select Bootloader Location Usually, leave it as the default, which is the main drive (/dev/sda).\nStep 8: Install Ubuntu The installer will copy files and install Ubuntu Wait 10–20 minutes depending on your system and internet speed Once complete, click Restart Now Remove the USB when prompted Step 9: Booting Into Ubuntu or Windows When the PC restarts, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the GRUB menu.\nUse arrow keys to select:\nUbuntu to boot into Ubuntu Windows Boot Manager to boot into Windows And by following these steps, you should have Ubuntu running on your system!\n⚡ Core Commands The main power of Linux lies in its terminal commands. Once you get familiar with these commands, you can get things done much faster compared to other operating systems.\nWorking With Files and Directories pwd # Show current working directory ls # List files in current directory touch hello.txt # Create a file named hello.txt head hello.csv # Show first 10 lines of hello.csv tail hello.csv # Show last 10 lines of hello.csv wc hello.txt # Count words in hello.txt grep setosa hello.txt # Search for \u0026#39;setosa\u0026#39; in hello.txt Combining Commands You can combine different commands using the | (pipe) character.\nExample:\ncat iris.csv | grep Setosa | wc -l This will give you the number of lines in the CSV containing the word \u0026ldquo;Setosa\u0026rdquo;.\n📦 Installing Software and Managing Packages sudo apt update # Update all installed packages sudo apt install \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt; # Install a specific package wget \u0026lt;URL\u0026gt; # Download files from a URL unzip \u0026lt;filename.zip\u0026gt; # Unzip a compressed file 🔐 Connect to a Remote Server ssh \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;server-ip\u0026gt; # Connect to a remote server via SSH sudo apt install openssh-server # Install OpenSSH server to allow SSH access 🔍 Process Management ps aux | grep \u0026lt;process-name\u0026gt; # Search for a specific running process 🎯 Conclusion Getting started with Linux may look very difficult at first, but as you get familiar with the Linux environment, you\u0026rsquo;ll realize that it is a very powerful system which teaches you a lot as a developer and is really fast and secure.\nHappy Linux Journey! 🐧🚀\n","permalink":"https://technameer.github.io/posts/linux/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently started using Linux and found it to be an amazing and powerful system.
