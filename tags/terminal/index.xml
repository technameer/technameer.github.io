&lt;p>Linux is an &lt;strong>open-source operating system&lt;/strong>, meaning it is software that manages the hardware of a computer. It is freely available for anyone to use and modify. Linux is built around the &lt;strong>Linux kernel&lt;/strong>, which is responsible for managing memory and system resources.
