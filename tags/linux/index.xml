&lt;p>Linux is an &lt;strong>open-source operating system&lt;/strong>, meaning it is software that manages the hardware of a computer. It is freely available for anyone to use and modify. Linux is built around the &lt;strong>Linux kernel&lt;/strong>, which is responsible for managing memory and system resources. Linux comes in different versions called &lt;strong>distributions (distros)&lt;/strong>, such as &lt;strong>Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu&lt;/strong>. Each distribution has its own interface and features, but the underlying architecture is the same.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
