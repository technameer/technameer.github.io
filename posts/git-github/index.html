You find that the problem can’t be solved any other way and the only solution to that problem is the one you implemented previously. But there is no way to revert it back. This is where Git comes in.\n📚 Introduction Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is used to manage different versions of code for small to large-scale projects. It has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.\nWhat is Version Control? Version control is a way to track and manage changes made to a project’s files over time. Using version control, we can move between different versions of the code.\nLocal vs Distributed Version Control Local Version Control: The code versions are stored in a single machine Distributed Version Control: The code is saved at every developer’s machine What is a Repository? Think of a repository as the folder where you store your entire road project. Every map, every design, every version, every experiment, everything you create sits inside this one place.\nIf Git is the tool you use to save checkpoints, and branches are the different side paths you build to test ideas, then the repository is the container that holds all of it. It’s the complete box that keeps your main road, your side paths, your history, your notes, and every change you’ve ever made.\nWhether you keep this box on your computer or upload it to GitHub’s storage garage, the repository is the home of your whole project.\n💾 How Does Git Store Versions of Code? Git just stores the changes made each time, so it is efficient to store the different versions. A commit in Git is a version of the code. In simple terms, it is a snapshot of the code with a message of what change has been made to the code in this version.\nGit uses unique strings called hashes to identify every single commit or snapshot.\n🔧 Installing Git Here I will be explaining how to install Git on Linux. If you are using Ubuntu, you just need to run the following command to install Git:\nsudo apt install git After that, you need to configure your username and email on Git so that it can identify the person that made the commit:\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\" git config --global user.email \"you@example.com\" 🚀 Using Git for a Project Now that you have installed Git on your system, you will use it in a project. Let’s say you are working on a project where you need version control.\nOpen terminal and navigate to the project directory Initialize Git using the command: git init After initializing, you can create commits in the projects and make versions of your code.\n🌿 Branches What are Branches in Git? Think of your project as a long road you’ve been building. One day you come up with a new idea that might make the road better. You don’t want to tear down the main road because you’re not fully sure if this new idea will work. So instead of changing the main road, you build a separate side path.\nOn this side path, you test new designs, try different curves, change the surface, and experiment freely. If the path turns out great, you connect it back to the main road. But if it turns into a mess or leads nowhere, you simply remove it and the main road stays perfectly safe.\nThat side path is a branch.\n🐙 GitHub Continuing the road example, think of GitHub as a giant storage garage where you keep all your road designs safe. Your computer holds your project, but anything can happen to a local machine. If it crashes or gets lost, your work disappears.\nSo you upload your entire road project to this secure garage. Now your team members can also access it, look at the design, suggest improvements, or even build their own side paths and send them back to you.\nGit is the tool you use to build and manage the roads GitHub is the place where you store those roads, share them, and work with others 🔗 Using GitHub You can host your local Git repository on GitHub so that you can collaborate and allow other developers to work on your project.\nConnecting Local Repository and GitHub Repo Login to GitHub and create a new repository Copy the URL of the repository and then run the command: git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository-name.git Check the remote origin URL in local repository by command: git remote -v You should see something like:\no o r r i i g g i i n n g g i i t t @ @ g g i i t t h h u u b b . . c c o o m m : : u u s s e e r r n n a a m m e e / / r r e e p p o o s s i i t t o o r r y y - - n n a a m m e e . . g g i i t t ( ( f p e u t s c h h ) ) Then push using the command: git push -u origin main 📝 Most Commonly Used Git and GitHub Commands Working with Git and GitHub requires remembering a few essential commands. Here’s a practical list divided by category.\n1. Setup and Configuration Command Description git config --global user.name \"Your Name\" Set your Git username git config --global user.email \"you@example.com\" Set your Git email git config --global core.editor nano Set default editor for commit messages git config --list Show current Git configuration 2. Repository Management Command Description git init Initialize a new Git repository in the current folder git clone Download an existing GitHub repository to your machine git remote -v Show connected remote repositories git remote add origin Link your local repository to a GitHub repository 3. Staging and Committing Changes Command Description git status Show the current status of files (modified, staged, untracked) git add Stage specific files for commit git add . Stage all changes in the directory git commit -m \"message\" Commit staged changes with a message git commit --amend Modify the last commit (add changes or change message) git log View the commit history git log --oneline View commit history in a concise form 4. Branching and Merging Command Description git branch List all branches in the repository git branch Create a new branch git checkout Switch to another branch git checkout -b Create a new branch and switch to it immediately git merge Merge a branch into the current branch git branch -d Delete a branch locally git branch -D Force delete a branch 5. Undoing Changes Command Description git restore Discard changes in the working directory git restore --staged Unstage a file git reset --hard Reset repository to a specific commit (⚠️ warning: discards changes) git revert Create a new commit that undoes a previous commit 6. Working with Remote Repositories Command Description git fetch Download changes from the remote repository (does not merge) git pull Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository git push Upload your commits to the remote repository git push -u origin Push the branch and set upstream tracking git pull --rebase Reapply your local commits on top of fetched changes 🎯 Conclusion Git and GitHub are essential tools for modern software development. Git helps you manage your code versions locally, while GitHub provides a platform to collaborate with others and keep your projects safe in the cloud.\nStart by learning the basic commands, practice creating branches, and don’t be afraid to experiment. Remember: with Git, you can always go back!\nHappy Coding! 🚀\n","wordCount":"1353","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-01T17:50:41+05:00","dateModified":"2025-12-01T17:50:41+05:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://technameer.github.io/posts/git-github/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nexmeer","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://technameer.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://technameer.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Nexmeer (Alt + H)">Nexmeer</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://technameer.github.io/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://technameer.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://technameer.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Introduction to Git & Github</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-12-01 17:50:41 +0500 +0500'>December 1, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>7 min</span></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#-introduction aria-label="📚 Introduction">📚 Introduction</a><ul><li><a href=#what-is-version-control aria-label="What is Version Control?">What is Version Control?</a></li><li><a href=#local-vs-distributed-version-control aria-label="Local vs Distributed Version Control">Local vs Distributed Version Control</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-a-repository aria-label="What is a Repository?">What is a Repository?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#-how-does-git-store-versions-of-code aria-label="💾 How Does Git Store Versions of Code?">💾 How Does Git Store Versions of Code?</a></li><li><a href=#-installing-git aria-label="🔧 Installing Git">🔧 Installing Git</a></li><li><a href=#-using-git-for-a-project aria-label="🚀 Using Git for a Project">🚀 Using Git for a Project</a></li><li><a href=#-branches aria-label="🌿 Branches">🌿 Branches</a><ul><li><a href=#what-are-branches-in-git aria-label="What are Branches in Git?">What are Branches in Git?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#-github aria-label="🐙 GitHub">🐙 GitHub</a></li><li><a href=#-using-github aria-label="🔗 Using GitHub">🔗 Using GitHub</a><ul><li><a href=#connecting-local-repository-and-github-repo aria-label="Connecting Local Repository and GitHub Repo">Connecting Local Repository and GitHub Repo</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#-most-commonly-used-git-and-github-commands aria-label="📝 Most Commonly Used Git and GitHub Commands">📝 Most Commonly Used Git and GitHub Commands</a><ul><li><a href=#1-setup-and-configuration aria-label="1.
