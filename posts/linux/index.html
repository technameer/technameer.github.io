🐧 What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning it is software that manages the hardware of a computer. It is freely available for anyone to use and modify. Linux is built around the Linux kernel, which is responsible for managing memory and system resources. Linux comes in different versions called distributions (distros), such as Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. Each distribution has its own interface and features, but the underlying architecture is the same."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://technameer.github.io/posts/linux/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.343cc480b9ffc8f04ccbe5e968ad674880cab773ec19905e93033065c1e7a804.css integrity="sha256-NDzEgLn/yPBMy+XpaK1nSIDKt3PsGZBekwMwZcHnqAQ=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://technameer.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://technameer.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://technameer.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://technameer.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://technameer.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://technameer.github.io/posts/linux/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://technameer.github.io/posts/linux/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nexmeer"><meta property="og:title" content="Getting Started With Linux"><meta property="og:description" content="I recently started using Linux and found it to be an amazing and powerful system.

Linux is built around the Linux kernel, which is responsible for managing memory and system resources. Linux comes in different versions called distributions (distros), such as Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. Each distribution has its own interface and features, but the underlying architecture is the same.\nIn this article I will be focusing on Ubuntu and how to install it.\n💻 Installing Linux (Ubuntu) There are different ways you can use Linux:\nWSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): If you are running Windows, you can install WSL and start using Ubuntu without installing it separately. Dual Boot: Install Ubuntu alongside your current operating system. Full Install: Completely remove the current operating system and base your system entirely on Linux. Here is a short overview of how you can install Linux through dual-boot:\nStep 1: Backing Up First you need to backup all your data because dual booting requires shrinking your disk, which risks data loss.\nStep 2: Download Ubuntu ISO Go to the Ubuntu official website Click Download for the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version Save the .iso file to a known location Step 3: Create a Bootable USB Using Rufus Requirements: USB drive with at least 8 GB free\nSteps:\nDownload and run Rufus Insert your USB drive Under Device, select your USB drive Click SELECT and choose the Ubuntu .iso file you downloaded Under Partition scheme, select: GPT for UEFI systems (most modern PCs) MBR for older BIOS systems (To check your system type: Press Win + R, type msinfo32, and look at BIOS Mode) File System: Leave as FAT32 Click START A prompt will appear asking to write in ISO Image mode or DD mode. Choose ISO Image mode Click OK to begin. Wait until Rufus finishes ✅ Your bootable USB is ready!\nStep 4: Shrink Your Windows Partition You need free space for Ubuntu.\nPress Win + X and select Disk Management Find your main Windows drive (usually C:) Right-click it and select Shrink Volume Enter the amount of space to shrink (at least 25–50 GB recommended for Ubuntu) Click Shrink You’ll see Unallocated space on your drive. Leave it as is; Ubuntu will use it during installation Step 5: Boot from the USB Insert the bootable USB and restart your PC Press the Boot Menu key (commonly F12, F10, Esc, or Del) when the manufacturer logo appears Select your USB drive from the list The Ubuntu boot menu will appear. Choose Install Ubuntu Step 6: Choose Installation Type Select Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager if this option appears If it doesn’t, select Something else (manual partitioning) Manual steps for “Something else”:\nClick the unallocated space Click + to create a new partition: Size: 25–50 GB (or more) Type: Primary Location: Beginning of this space Use as: Ext4 journaling file system Mount point: / Step 7: Select Bootloader Location Usually, leave it as the default, which is the main drive (/dev/sda).\nStep 8: Install Ubuntu The installer will copy files and install Ubuntu Wait 10–20 minutes depending on your system and internet speed Once complete, click Restart Now Remove the USB when prompted Step 9: Booting Into Ubuntu or Windows When the PC restarts, you’ll see the GRUB menu.\nUse arrow keys to select:\nUbuntu to boot into Ubuntu Windows Boot Manager to boot into Windows And by following these steps, you should have Ubuntu running on your system!\n⚡ Core Commands The main power of Linux lies in its terminal commands. Once you get familiar with these commands, you can get things done much faster compared to other operating systems.\nWorking With Files and Directories pwd # Show current working directory ls # List files in current directory touch hello.txt # Create a file named hello.txt head hello.csv # Show first 10 lines of hello.csv tail hello.csv # Show last 10 lines of hello.csv wc hello.txt # Count words in hello.txt grep setosa hello.txt # Search for 'setosa' in hello.txt Combining Commands You can combine different commands using the | (pipe) character.\nExample:\ncat iris.csv | grep Setosa | wc -l This will give you the number of lines in the CSV containing the word “Setosa”.\n📦 Installing Software and Managing Packages sudo apt update # Update all installed packages sudo apt install # Install a specific package wget # Download files from a URL unzip # Unzip a compressed file 🔐 Connect to a Remote Server ssh @ # Connect to a remote server via SSH sudo apt install openssh-server # Install OpenSSH server to allow SSH access 🔍 Process Management ps aux | grep # Search for a specific running process 🎯 Conclusion Getting started with Linux may look very difficult at first, but as you get familiar with the Linux environment, you’ll realize that it is a very powerful system which teaches you a lot as a developer and is really fast and secure.\nHappy Linux Journey!
